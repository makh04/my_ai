      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Tips for Generating Better Images</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-400 mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Be Specific:</strong> The more detailed your prompt, the better the results.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Styles:</strong> Try adding "in the style of [artist]", "photorealistic", or "digital art".</li>
        <li><strong>Use Negative Prompts:</strong> Some tools allow you to specify what you *don't* want to see.</li>
        <li><strong>Iterate:</strong> Generate multiple images and refine your prompts based on the output.</li>
      </ul>
