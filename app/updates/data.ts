    🗓️ New Feature Drop: Just Say It, and Pika Schedules It
Okay, this one’s gonna make your life way easier. You can now talk to Pika like you would to a friend and it’ll actually schedule stuff for you. No buttons, no typing — just say what you want.

You can be super casual, like:

“Hey Pika, remind me to take my meds every Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday until October 21, 2025.”

“Schedule a meeting at 4 PM tomorrow.”

“Add an event called ‘Anime binge’ at 8 PM tonight.”

“Remind me to call Nabil day after tomorrow at 2 pm.”

Yup, it gets all that. Even recurring stuff. Even weird combos. Even long-term reminders. You say it, it locks it in.

Some fun examples:

“Pika, remind me to drink water every 2 hours starting now.”

“Add a task: ‘Finish chemistry notes’ at 11 PM tonight.”

“Schedule a reminder to stretch every morning at 7 until nov.”

“Set a recurring event: ‘Eat medicine’ every Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday till October 21, 2025.”

Boom. Done. No stress.
What’s cool about it:
You talk like a human, it listens like one.
Works for one-time stuff, daily routines, or long-term goals.
You can save your favorite commands and reuse them.
It’s like having a personal assistant who actually gets you.

Try it out next time you think “ugh I’ll do it later.” Just say it to Pika and forget about it — it’ll remember for you. Let me know if you want to build a wild recurring chain or automate your whole week. I’m down.

      ## What's New: Make custom automation command in your wish

      Big news! Now you can make your own command Like telling pika to open chrome then type .... then press enter and much more custom commands. It is like you can give details information to Pika AI voice assistant. and there is no limit of how many step you tell to Pika.assistant

      So, basically you can perform all task that is possible to do with keyboard. You can break the process and tell him to do this-this. For example you can say "Pika do this then click this then press this then again to this then repeat this step multiple times". This is cool right ?

      Let me show you some more examples:

      Examples,

      1) Pika open chrome then type the link of instagram's reels page link then press enter then press down button for scrolling and make the time interval for every reels and scroll 60 second and after watching 20 reels turn ths tab off
      BOOM ! Now pika will let you watch 10 reels then turn the tab off

      It's pretty straightforward, but super useful for multitaskers and people who love to keep things organized. And you can make more custom task like this

      Features:
      - Automate about all the possible task
      - Save the same prompt and use it as custom automation
      - Make your own function which would make it your own personal AI Assistant

      Hope this makes your workflow smoother! As always, let us know if you have any thoughts or suggestions.

      ## Bug Fix: App Closing Issue

      We know this one was a bit annoying, but we’ve fixed the issue where the app wouldn’t close properly. You should now be able to exit out of Pika without any weirdness.

      It’s a small fix, but it should make a big difference when you're done using the app and ready to move on to something else.

      Thanks for your patience on this one!
